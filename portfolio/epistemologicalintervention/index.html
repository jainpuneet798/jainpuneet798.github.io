         <h1>Epistemological Intervention: Collaborative Ethnography between a human and a machine-learning algorithm</h1>
         <p>Epistemological Intervention (EI) is a research-creation work that situates itself at the intersection
of human-computer interaction, anthropology, and artificial intelligence research - asking the
following research question: How can we design interfaces that bring together the human and
the non-human to create new forms of epistemologies? EI thus brings in collaboration, a human
and a non-human (a machine learning algorithm) to search for new ethnographic methodologies
of knowing the world, what Anthropologist Dara Culhane also refers to as “co-creative”
knowledge making.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Projects/EpistemologicalIntervention/img1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>While computer scientists have developed sophisticated image-to-text computer vision
algorithms (algorithms that describe images through text using machine learning), most of these
algorithms (Johnson, 2012) (Ren, 2015) are still perceived and expected to use the same
knowledge conventions of describing images comparable with humans. In cases, when they
don’t describe images similar to the perceptions of the humans, the algorithms are considered as
less accurate or having poor “generalization” capabilities. However, through this research work, it
is posited that image-to-text computer vision algorithms (even with less accuracy) showcase a
different trajectory of epistemological intervention to understand cultures - an ethnographic
technique also practiced by anthropologists to understand and analyze cultures unknown to their
own.
This work thus presents an unusual ethnographic study performed by a human and a machine
learning algorithm using an interactive web based interface. While the ethnographer uses his
prior embodied knowledge of living in the world to intervene in a different culture (a maker space
culture) and logs his findings on the interface, the computer vision machine learning algorithm in
parallel uses the knowledge gained from the Visual Genome Dataset (Krishna et al., 2017) that it
has been trained on and adds to the database - merging an analog human and a digital machine
to co-create new forms of epistemologies.</p>
<h4 id="methodology">Methodology</h4>
<p>A visual ethnographic approach (Collier, 1986) is used by the human ethnographer to observe
and describe the culture around him by typing text on the web-based interface developed using
p5 javascript library. The interface also uses the RunwayML’s (<a href="https://runwayml.com/">https://runwayml.com/</a>) pre-trained
machine learning model, DenseCap, that captions images in real time with the help of a handheld
camera by the ethnographer and logs the results into the data-base while displaying it on
the screen.
Findings
The following observations were made during the first trial run of the interface:</p>
<ol>
<li>The observations made by the human ethnographer were made with patience as
compared to findings by the machine learning algorithm that logged 10-20 observations per
minute.</li>
<li>While the human never repeated the observations once added to the database, the
machine learning algorithm often repeated the same findings.</li>
<li>The final database was a juxtaposition of human ethnographer and machine learning
algorithm observations.</li>
</ol>
