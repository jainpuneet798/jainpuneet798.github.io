         <h1>Umwelten</h1>
         <p>While most of us are stacked together next to each other in rectangles on our computer screens in this pandemic, the work &lsquo;Umwelten&rsquo; asks us to once again reconsider the futures that we had planned for. Umwelten invites a human, a machine learning algorithm, and a plant to meet once again in a sensorial plane to question and reformulate our relationships with one another through an exchange - a sensory exchange where our &lsquo;umwelts&rsquo; entangle, overlap, and are morphed with one another.</p>
<p>The concept of &lsquo;Umwelt&rsquo; (translated as environment in English) was proposed by a German biologist Jacob Johann Von Uexk端ll. Uexk端ll believed that one should not perceive an animal as an objective entity (a physio-chemical being) but rather contended an animal to be discerned on the basis of their behavior in the environments they inhabit. Therefore according to Uexk端ll, an animal together with its environment form a whole system that he called an &ldquo;Umwelt&rdquo;. Moreover, Uexk端ll states that nature conforms to a plan where organic and inorganic beings cohere together in a compositional musical harmony. He interprets organisms as natural tones that try to harmonize with other beings (both living and non-living).</p>
<p>With &lsquo;Umwelten&rsquo; as a research creation project, we are interested in the kind of musical harmony that emerges when a plant, a human, and a machine learning algorithm have a sensorial exchange among themselves. This research intervention posits questions like - How do the umwelts of human and more than human entangle, overlap and are morphed with one another in such an exchange? Does such an invitation of bringing all these entities together also adds a confusion - a confusion emerging from different spatial and temporal perceptions of the three entities? If so, how do we see new futures where such an interweaving of entities is not only crucial but also help us to bring ourselves back to the ontological question of being v/s becoming.</p>

<h4 id="the-set-up">The set up</h4>
<p>The above set up consisting of a human, a Mimosa (or touch me not) plant, and a camera (that acts as a machinic eye) asks the human to type while the typography (color, font size, and spacing between the letters) dynamically evolves based on the typing speed of the human. Meanwhile, a camera points to a Mimosa plant capturing images of the plant frame by frame, sending it to machine learning model trained on the image data set of the plant - classifying the plant into two categories (closed or open) with respective probabilities. While the leaves of the &lsquo;touch me not&rsquo; plant are susceptible to close or open depending on the external stimuli (sunlight, a human hand or a fly), the machine learning algorithm continously predicts the leaves to be open or closed acting as a &ldquo;sensing&rdquo; machinic eye. The probabilities of the classification again influence the typography on the screen thus disrupting the human sensory input-output on the screen. Hence, this dynamically evolving typography on the screen manifests in itself the spatial-temporal relations of the plant (which takes approximately 10 minutes to open its leaves once closed because of an external stimulus), the clock time of the predictive machine learning algorithm, and the physiological time of a human being.</p>

<h4 id="activity-description-75-motswords-">Activity description (75 mots/words) *</h4>
<p>The work Umwelten is a confusion between a human, a machine learning algorithm, and a plant -  a confusion that emerges when the spatio-temporal perceptions of a human and a &lsquo;touch me not&rsquo; plant entangle, overlap and morph with the &ldquo;sensing&rdquo; capabilities of a machine learning algorithm. This confusion is visualized in the form of a dynamic typography where the color, spacing, and size of the letters dynamically evolve over time.</p>

<p>This work caters to the theme and the topic of &ldquo;interplay between human and more than human sentience&rdquo; through an invitation to the human and the non-human to exchange a dialogue to re-question the decided futures - a dialogue seen as an exchange of signs between a human, an ML algorithm and a plant as they reformulate their relationships through dynamically evolving typography pulling us back to the ontological question of being v/s becoming.</p>
