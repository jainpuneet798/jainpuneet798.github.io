      <description>Some of the input modalities used by people for interactions are a mouse, keyboard, etc. which mostly are operated using hands.
However, most of these devices seem futile when the users are motor-impaired or have constrained body movements. The following project is a virtual keyboard that is operated through eye-gaze rather than hands. The keyboard has a QWERTY layout and is integrated with a customized machine learning algorithm to dynamically adapt dwell time of the keys.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
